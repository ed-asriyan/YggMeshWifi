# YggMesh
Yggdrasil over WiFi Mesh

## The Idea
This project builds a mesh network for cases where normal network infrastructure is unavailable or unreliable.

- Routers connect to each other over [802.11s WiFi mesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11s).
- Yggdrasil runs directly on top of those 802.11s interfaces and provides end-to-end encrypted IPv6 mesh routing.
- Every node runs an open WiFi hotspot. Phones and laptops that connect to it are placed directly into the Yggdrasil network — they receive a globally-routable `200::/7` IPv6 address via SLAAC automatically.
- All WiFi clients can resolve and access [Alfis](https://alfis.name) domains (such as `.ygg` and other Yggdrasil services) out of the box, thanks to integrated Alfis DNS forwarding.
- No internet connection, cloud service, or pre-configuration is required. Flash the firmware and the node is ready.
- Clearnet access is **not** provided by this project.

Technically, it combines two layers:
- **[802.11s WiFi mesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11s)** — routers form a wireless backhaul using the 802.11s protocol with SAE encryption. No L2 routing daemon is involved — the 802.11s interfaces are used directly as the transport for Yggdrasil.
- **[Yggdrasil](https://yggdrasil-network.github.io)** — an end-to-end encrypted L3 overlay network that runs directly on the 802.11s interfaces. Every node gets a permanent `200::/7` IPv6 address derived from its public key. Nodes discover each other via multicast on the mesh interfaces — no static configuration, no central registry, no internet required.
- **WiFi hotspot** — each node creates a public, open WiFi access point (`YggMesh`) with 802.11r/k/v seamless roaming. Connected clients receive a `200::/7` Yggdrasil IPv6 address via SLAAC.

## How to Deploy
**Requirements:** A supported OpenWrt router (see table below).

**Supported devices:**
| Device | Target | Notes |

| Asus RT-AX53U | ramips/mt7621 | WiFi 6, DSA switch |
| GL.iNet GL-AR300M16 (16 MB) | ath79/generic | 2.4 GHz only |
| TP-Link CPE710 v1 | ath79/generic | 5 GHz outdoor, 23 dBi directional |
| Cudy AP3000 Outdoor V1 | mediatek/filogic | WiFi 6, outdoor |

> [!WARNING]
> This project is on extremely early stage. Something may break even if it's supposed ot work. Do it on your own risk. 

**What each node does after first boot:**
- Brings up 802.11s mesh interfaces on all available radios and joins the shared mesh with SAE encryption.
- Runs Yggdrasil directly on the 802.11s interfaces, discovering peers via multicast. No static peers or internet connection needed.
- Advertises a `300::/64` Yggdrasil subnet on `br-private` so clients receive a `200::/7` IPv6 address via SLAAC.
- Creates an open public WiFi hotspot (`YggMesh`) across all nodes.

**Steps:**
1. Download the firmware for your device from the [Releases](https://github.com/ed-asriyan/YggMesh/releases) page, or [build it yourself](#building).
2. Flash it to your router via LuCI (System → Backup/Flash Firmware) or `sysupgrade`:
   ```
   sysupgrade -v /tmp/openwrt-*-sysupgrade.bin
   ```
3. Wait for the router to reboot. First boot takes about 30 seconds longer than usual while the node configures itself.
4. Repeat for every router you want in the mesh. No per-node configuration is needed — all nodes are identical.

> [!WARNING]
> **Change the default root password after first boot.**
> All nodes ship with the password `yggmesh`. Change it via LuCI → System → Administration or by running `passwd` over SSH.

### Building
To build firmware yourself you need Linux x86_64 with `wget`, `zstd`, `make`, and `python3`.

```bash
./scripts/build.sh <device>
```

The script downloads the OpenWrt Image Builder on first run (~1.5 GB per target). Output lands in `output/`.

```bash
./scripts/build.sh axt1800        # GL-AXT1800
./scripts/build.sh cpe710         # CPE710 (5 GHz outdoor)
./scripts/build.sh ap3000outdoor  # Cudy AP3000 Outdoor
```

## Verification
To verify the mesh is working correctly, set up a 3-node linear test (A → B → C).

### 1. Prepare three nodes
1. Flash the firmware to three devices.
2. Ensure none of them are plugged into your normal home network or internet router. They should only have power.

### 2. Arrange them in a line
1. Place **Node A** at one end of your house.
2. Place **Node B** somewhere in the middle.
3. Place **Node C** at the other end.
4. Power them all on and wait about 3 minutes for first-boot configuration and mesh forming.

*Note: Ensure the distance is large enough that a phone near Node A cannot see the Wi-Fi from Node C.*

### 3. Connect your phone
1. Turn off mobile data on your phone.
2. Stand physically near **Node A**.
3. Connect to the `YggMesh` WiFi hotspot (it is an open network).

### 4. Test the connection
1. Open a browser on your phone.
2. Try to load a public Yggdrasil website. You can find public websites  at https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/services.html.

If the site loads, your mesh is successfully formed and routing Yggdrasil traffic end-to-end across multiple hops.
